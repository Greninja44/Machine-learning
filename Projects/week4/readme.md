# Handwritten Digit Recognition (1-10) using TensorFlow

This Jupyter Notebook implements a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits (1-10) from 28×28 grayscale images in the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
- Normalizes 28×28 grayscale images for better training
- Builds and trains a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluates model accuracy and performance on test data
- Predicts handwritten digits from input images

## Installation
Ensure you have Python and the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
